But I ain't worried 'bout it right now (right now)
Keeping dreams alive, 1999, heroes
I ain't worried 'bout it right now (right now)
Swimmin' in the floods, dancing on the clouds below
I ain't worried 'bout it

I don't know what you've been told
But time is running out so spend it like it's gold
I'm living like I'm nine-zeros
Got no regrets even when I'm broke (yeah)
